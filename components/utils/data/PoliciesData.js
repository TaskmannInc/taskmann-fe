    answer: `We would like to thank you for supporting and safeguarding a welcoming environment.
    
    Our guidelines were created to make every experience feel secure, polite, and enjoyable. They are applicable to all users of the Taskmann platform including but not limited to Taskers, customers, and companies. Additionally, in some cases, where we become aware of conduct outside the Taskmann Marketplace Platform—including, but not limited to, information from other platforms—that may endanger the platform’s security, our policies also apply to that conduct.

    The guidelines below help explain some of the kinds of positive community engagement on the Taskmann platform.
    Not abiding to any one of our guidelines may constitute a breach or violations of terms of your agreement with uber and may result in the loss of access to Taskmann platform.
    We update our guidelines regularly so please make sure you are up to date with the most recent Taskmann Guidelines.
    Please take a moment to read them.    
    
    The community guidelines apply to everyone that signs up for a Taskmann account.

Be aware that you might engage with people in the Taskmann community who don’t look like you, don’t think like you, or come from different backgrounds. Please be mindful of those variations. The Taskmann Platform will not accept discrimination based on race or any other legally protected characteristic, and violators risk losing access to the applications. Additionally, you can notify Taskmann if you see discrimination occurring, and we will deal with any reports in accordance with our standards.

    Respect can also be earned by your actions in addition to your words. For instance, make every effort to arrive on time for your appointment. It’s also polite not to yell, curse, or slam doors. Additionally, by picking up after yourself, whether it be by taking your garbage home or wiping up a spilled beverage, you’ll contribute to everyone else’s enjoyment of the journey.

    All Third-Party Charges are payable instantly, and Taskmann or a Taskmann associate will arrange payment using the selected payment method specified in your Account. You will then receive a receipt. You consent to Taskmann or a Taskmann affiliate using a backup payment method in your account, if one is available, on behalf of the Third-Party Provider in the event that your primary payment method for your Account is found to be invalid, expired, or otherwise unable to be charged.
    
    You agree that a Taskmann affiliate may, at any time, at the Third-Party Provider’s direction or for any other reason in the Taskmann affiliate’s sole discretion, establish or modify Third Party Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Taskmann Services, including when you select an additional service that entails an additional fee. Furthermore, you realize and agree that during periods of high demand, Third Party Charges applicable in specific geographic locations may significantly increase. Taskmann will make a reasonable effort to make sure that the Taskmann affiliate advises you of any potential third-party charges, but you’ll be responsible for any third-party fees incurred through your Account. You agree that the fact that a charge from Taskmann or a Taskmann affiliate appears on your payment card statement does not necessarily mean that Taskmann or the Taskmann affiliate actually sold the good or service; rather, it just means that Taskmann or the Taskmann Affiliate facilitated the transaction, and the actual Tasker is the one who is identified on your receipt.
    
    You acknowledge that a Taskmann affiliate may occasionally offer Promo Codes to some customers, which could lead to different prices being charged for the same or similar services or items received by using the Taskmann Services. You acknowledge that such Promo Codes are given to you without charge, have no monetary value, cannot be used to purchase goods or services with actual money, cannot be transferred, and, unless you are also given access to them, have no impact on how you use the Taskmann Services.
    
    Tips
    The Third-Party Provider is expected to get compensation for the goods or services provided under this payment system. Taskmann does not designate any part of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third-Party Provider. You acknowledge and agree that while you are free to provide any Third-Party Provider that gives you services or items received through the Taskmann Services extra money as a tip, you are not required to. Gratuities are not required. You will have the chance to rate your experience and provide further comments on your Third-Party Provider after you have received the products or services you ordered through the Taskmann Services.
    
    Cancellations
    Prior to the arrival of a Third-Party Provider, you may choose to cancel your request for services; however, in that instance, a cancellation fee can apply. In accordance with the cancellation procedures of Taskmann or its affiliates, you may be entitled to a refund for any fees paid if the services are cancelled for any reason not attributable to you.
    
    You can cancel your order at any moment before the third-party provider starts preparing your products or services if you buy goods or services from them. If the tasker started the service, you will no longer be able to cancel your purchase without paying a fee, which will not exceed the full cost of your requested items. You will also be charged the entire amount for the services you ordered from the Third-Party Provider if you cancel your order after the service has started. In some cases, Taskmann may provide a partial refund to you if you cancel prior to tasker starting the requested service, at its sole discretion.
    
    Taskmann is dedicated to provide a fair cancellation policy, at its own discretion.
    
    Repair, Cleaning or Other Fees
    If you cause damage to an equipment or piece of property while using the Services, Taskmann may charge you a fee. Based on the kind of damage and its severity, Taskmann will decide the fee’s amount at its exclusive discretion. Before charging a fee, Taskmann maintains the right to confirm or otherwise demand documentation of the damages. Taskmann reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or damage on behalf of the Third-Party Provider using your payment method designated in your Account. This will happen in the event that a Third-Party Provider reports the need for Repair or replacement and that request is verified by a Taskmann affiliate in the affiliate’s reasonable discretion. Such sums are non-refundable and will be transferred by Taskmann to the relevant Third-Party Provider.
    
    As a result of or in connection with your failure to comply with these Taskmann Terms, you may also be held liable for additional fees or charges, including without limitation for transactions that could not be completed successfully.

    Governing Law
    Disputes Resolution
    All disputes will have to be resolved through arbitration. You will not be eligible to get money or other relief through a court proceeding.
    
    Regarding this arbitration requirement, you are allowed to consult a lawyer for advice or representation.
    
    All disputes arising out of or relating in any way to:
    
    i. Term
    
    ii. the Taskmann Services
    
    iii. your access to or use of the Application
    
    iv. advertisements, promotions, or oral or written statements related to the Applications or any other Taskmann branded product will, unless prohibited by law, be finally and conclusively decided by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules (“ADRIC Rules”) of the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. (“ADRIC”). You may choose to have the arbitration in either English or French. The arbitrator may hold the arbitration in person, by telephone, or online, as he or she sees fit.
    
    The ADRIC Rules are available by, for example, searching <www.google.ca> to locate “ADRIC Arbitration Rules” or by clicking here. You can also contact ADRIC at 1-877-475-4353 or <www.adric.ca>.
    
    You will have to pay some fees to arbitrate, as described in the ADRIC Rules.
    
    To resolve the disagreement, the party making the claim must first attempt informal negotiation with the opposing party in good faith for a period of not less than 30 days nor more than 45 days, unless an extension is agreed upon. Any otherwise relevant restriction term will be tolled during the negotiation period (temporarily suspended).
    
    There is nothing in this that prevents you from submitting a claim to a government body.
    
    You may decide to bring any specific claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment in court rather than through arbitration if you wish to do so. Taskmann acknowledges that you have a right to choose the venue for your specific sexual harassment or sexual assault claim, but does not renounce the enforcement under this provision.
    
    Both the termination of this Agreement and either party’s bankruptcy does not affect this arbitration requirement. The other portions of it continue to apply even if one element is found to be void or unenforceable.

    Without prior explicit consent from Taskmann, you are not permitted to assign or transfer these Taskmann Terms in whole or in part. You agree that Taskmann may assign or transfer these Taskmann Terms, in whole or in part, to any of the following parties:

However, the entire provision or a portion of it will be deemed to not be a part of these Taskmann Terms in that case. In that case, given the content and intent of these Taskmann Terms, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or part thereof with a provision or part thereof that is legal, valid, and enforceable and that, to the greatest extent permissible, achieves the same result as the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or part thereof.`,
